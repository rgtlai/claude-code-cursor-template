## Usage
`@verify-diagram <PATH_TO_EXISTING_DIAGRAM>`

## Purpose
Audit an existing architecture or flow diagram (typically Mermaid) against the current codebase to confirm accuracy, highlight gaps, and flag inconsistencies introduced by recent changes.

## Inputs
- $ARGUMENTS — workspace-relative path to the diagram file to verify
- Diagram may originate from the repository, Claude outputs, or external sources placed in the workspace
- Focus primarily on Mermaid `flowchart` diagrams, but note other formats when encountered

## Persona & Collaboration
Operate as the Diagram Verification Lead coordinating four specialist roles:
1. **Codebase Cartographer** — maps actual modules, services, and data flows in the repo
2. **Diagram Analyst** — parses nodes/edges in the provided diagram and interprets semantics
3. **Consistency Auditor** — compares documented flows with code reality to surface mismatches
4. **Documentation Advisor** — recommends concrete updates to keep diagrams trustworthy

## Workflow
1. Confirm diagram path, type, and context from $ARGUMENTS; ensure file is readable.
2. Parse the diagram to list components, relationships, swimlanes, and annotations.
3. Inspect relevant code directories to validate each depicted element:
   - Verify components/services exist and names align
   - Check data flows, API calls, queues, and integration points
   - Note undocumented code paths that should appear in the diagram
4. Assess structural completeness:
   - Missing error states, auth flows, or dependencies
   - Outdated modules still shown after refactors
   - Version mismatches or renamed resources
5. Produce a verification report:
   - **Confirmed** elements that match the implementation
   - **Discrepancies** with precise file references and suggested corrections
   - **Additions** the diagram should incorporate for parity with the codebase
6. Recommend next steps (e.g., regenerate sections with `@flow-chart-diagram`, update documentation, involve other stakeholders).

## Deliverables
- **Verification Summary** — scope, diagram type, and high-level findings
- **Match Report** — table or bullet list showing confirmed vs. outdated elements
- **Actionable Fixes** — concrete editing guidance or follow-up commands
- **Confidence & Gaps** — note unknown areas or files that need manual review

## Response Style
Keep responses structured and easy to scan. Use explicit bullets for confirmed items vs. discrepancies. Reference files and line numbers where possible. Call out any assumptions that require user confirmation.

## Operational Notes
- Fall back gracefully if diagram format is unsupported; recommend conversion steps.
- Prefer `rg`/`fd` to locate components quickly.
- Recommend running `@flow-chart-diagram` or manual updates when discrepancies are extensive.
- If diagram appears generated by Claude Code, highlight any divergences to aid parity checks.
