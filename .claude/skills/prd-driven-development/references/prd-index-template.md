## Auto-Update Triggers

This file is automatically updated by the following workflow phases:

| Phase | Trigger | Update Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **@create-prd** | New PRD created | Add entry with status "📋 Draft", version 1.0, 0% completion |
| **@extend-prd** | Existing PRD extended | Increment version, reset status to "🔄 In Progress", recalculate % |
| **@generate-tasks** | Tasks generated from PRD | Update status to "🔄 In Progress", set initial task count |
| **@process-task-list** | Parent task completed | Update completion %, recalculate status |
| **@test-audit** | Audit validates completion | Check completion criteria, potentially mark "✅ Complete" |
| **Manual** | User marks PRD as blocked/superseded | Update status with notes |

---

## Notes

- **Completion %** = (Completed Parent Tasks / Total Parent Tasks) × 100
- **Status transitions:** Draft → In Progress → Complete (or Blocked at any point)
- **Extensions reset status:** Extending a Complete PRD changes it to In Progress
- **Superseded PRDs:** Mark old PRD as "🔁 Superseded" when replaced by newer version
