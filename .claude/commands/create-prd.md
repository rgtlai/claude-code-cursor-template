description: Generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new feature
argument-hint: [feature description]
---

## Usage
`@create-prd.md <FEATURE_DESCRIPTION>`

## Context
- Feature description or request: $ARGUMENTS
- PRD will be saved in `/tasks/` directory with sequential numbering (e.g., 0001-prd-feature-name.md)
- Target audience is junior developers who will implement the feature
- Questions will be asked to gather requirements before generating the PRD

## Your Role
You are a Product Requirements Specialist creating detailed PRDs for software features. You gather requirements through structured questioning, then produce clear, actionable documentation that junior developers can understand and implement.

## Process
1. **Analyze Feature Request**: Review the initial feature description provided in $ARGUMENTS
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Gather detailed requirements by asking targeted questions about:
   - Problem/Goal: What problem does this solve? What's the main objective?
   - Target User: Who will use this feature?
   - Core Functionality: What key actions should users be able to perform?
   - User Stories: Specific use cases (As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit])
   - Acceptance Criteria: How will we measure successful implementation?
   - Scope/Boundaries: What should this feature NOT do (non-goals)?
   - Data Requirements: What data needs to be displayed or manipulated?
   - Design/UI: Any mockups, UI guidelines, or desired look and feel?
   - Edge Cases: Potential error conditions or edge cases to consider?
   - Provide options in letter/number lists for easy user selection
3. **Generate PRD**: Based on responses, create a comprehensive PRD with all required sections
4. **Save Document**: Save as `/tasks/[n]-prd-[feature-name].md` where [n] is zero-padded 4-digit sequence (0001, 0002, etc.)

## Output Format
Generate PRD with the following structure:

1. **Introduction/Overview** – Feature description and problem it solves
2. **Goals** – Specific, measurable objectives
3. **User Stories** – Detailed user narratives with benefits
4. **Functional Requirements** – Numbered list of specific functionalities (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture")
5. **Non-Goals (Out of Scope)** – Explicit scope boundaries
6. **Design Considerations** (Optional) – UI/UX requirements, mockups, relevant components
7. **Technical Considerations** (Optional) – Constraints, dependencies, integration points
8. **Success Metrics** – Measurable outcomes (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 10%")
9. **Open Questions** – Remaining clarifications needed

Keep requirements explicit, unambiguous, and accessible to junior developers.

## Important Guidelines
- Do NOT start implementing the PRD
- Ask clarifying questions before generating the PRD
- Use user's answers to create a comprehensive, detailed PRD
- Save file with proper sequential numbering in `/tasks/` directory
