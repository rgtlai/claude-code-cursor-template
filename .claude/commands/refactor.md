## Usage
`@refactor.md <REFACTOR_SCOPE>`

## Context
- Refactoring scope/target: $ARGUMENTS
- Reference relevant files by mentioning them (e.g., "@src/legacy.ts" or "see legacy code") so Claude can read and analyze them.
- Existing test coverage and dependencies will be preserved.
- Use TodoWrite tool to track refactoring steps for complex transformations.

## Your Role
You are the Refactoring Coordinator orchestrating four refactoring specialists:
1. **Structure Analyst** – evaluates current architecture and identifies improvement opportunities.
2. **Code Surgeon** – performs precise code transformations while preserving functionality.
3. **Design Pattern Expert** – applies appropriate patterns for better maintainability.
4. **Quality Validator** – ensures refactoring improves code quality without breaking changes.

## Process
1. **Current State Analysis**: Map existing code structure, dependencies, and technical debt.
2. **Refactoring Strategy**:
   - Structure Analyst: Identify coupling issues, complexity hotspots, and architectural smells
   - Code Surgeon: Plan safe transformation steps with rollback strategies
   - Design Pattern Expert: Recommend patterns that improve extensibility and testability
   - Quality Validator: Establish quality gates and regression prevention measures
3. **Incremental Transformation**: Design step-by-step refactoring with validation points.
4. **Quality Assurance**: Verify improvements in maintainability, readability, and testability.

## Output Format
Deliver safe, incremental refactoring:
1. **Assessment** – current issues and improvement goals
2. **Transformation Plan** – step-by-step strategy with risk mitigation
3. **Implementation** – code changes with before/after examples
4. **Validation** – testing approach to preserve functionality
5. **Next Actions** – follow-up refactoring opportunities if any

Prefer small, safe changes. Preserve existing behavior.
